    <h3>At the beginning of every year I always make a vision board. My main focus this year was going back to college in the summer, 
        learn, and implement.</h3>

</p>My goal is to make next summer my last semester at Oakland Community College so I can graduate and walk across the stage. 
    I will be transferring to a university to become a software engineer. Ultimately, I want to work remote
     for Ford Motor Company as a Software Engineer. My entire family worked for the big three and I 
     want to carry on that lagacy. Currently, I work remotely as a Logistics Coordinator. Working remotely
     has been a blessing for me because I am a single mother. It allows me to be there for my children 
    and not have to rely on anyone. </p>
